# Crop Connect

Crop Connect is a cutting-edge agricultural platform designed to empower farmers with data-driven insights and tools to optimize their operations. By leveraging advanced technologies like computer vision, machine learning, and real-time data analysis, we provide a suite of features to support farmers at every stage of the agricultural process by predicting weather patterns, assessing soil health, diagnosing crop status, providing expert advice, receive message alerts and visualize overall farm health.

## Inspiration towards Ometeotl: Crop Connect
Two years ago, the state of Nuevo Le√≥n faced a severe water crisis, disrupting water services across many regions. However, the core issue stemmed from the fact that nearly 57% of the state's water supply is allocated to crops and agriculture, making farmers the most affected by the crisis. During our experience at the NASA Space Apps challenge, we uncovered a critical truth: the lack of technological infrastructure in our country not only exacerbates this issue but is a daily struggle for farmers. With this realization, is how the idea of Crop Connect stemmed.
